## Completed Work
* The program could current scan a sample site's product page. I have not adjusted it to scan an entire link or found out how to search for specific elements. It can only scan the product amount so far
## Remaining Steps
* Find a way to scan sites with SSL certificates
* Find a way to scan the entire elements of the homepage and not just a specific product page
